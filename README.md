# Flappy Bird Terminal Edition

This project was just to hack together a Flappy Bird in Console to just play
with the `curses` library. To run, you just need to have python and run the
game by calling `python flappy.py` in the console! Feel free to fork and make
it your own or extend or improve on it!

Cheers!
