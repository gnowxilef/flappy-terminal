# Flappy Bird Terminal Edition

This project was just to hack together a Flappy Bird in Console to just play
with the `curses` library. To run, you just need to have python the `curses`
library installed (only windows would have issues) and run the game by calling
`python flappy.py` in the console! You should make sure your window is maximized
so you can see the whole game :P Feel free to fork and make it your own or
extend or improve on it!

Cheers!
